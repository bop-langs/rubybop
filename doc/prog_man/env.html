<h1>BOP Environment Variables</h1>

<p>BOP uses two environment variables as follows.  They can be set in a shell window or in the parallelized program.</p>

<h2>BOP_GroupSize</h2>

<p>The environment variable controls how many processors a BOP execution should use.  By default, it is set to 2, which means 2 PPR tasks are executed in parallel each time.  To set the variable to a new value, e.g. 8, use the following command in a Bash shell</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
BOP_GroupSize=8;export BOP_GroupSize
</pre>

<h2>BOP_Verbose</h2>

<p>The environment variable controls how much diagnosis output to generate during an execution.  To suppress all internal output, set the variable to 0 using the following command in a Bash shell</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
BOP_Verbose=0;export BOP_Verbose
</pre>

<p>A positive verbose level shows the parallel execution in increasing amount of details depending on the level.  Here is short summary: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>BOP_Verbose = 1</code> prints out information about task creation and completion, conflicts in shared data access if there is any, and the status of sequential execution (called the understudy).  It generates a report at the end of the execution.</li>
<li><code>BOP_Verbose = 2</code> prints out information about the execution of ordered blocks and the internal signaling before and after a PPR task.</li>
<li><code>BOP_Verbose = 6</code> prints out all information BOP tracks internally including the location and time of shared data access when recorded by <code>BOP_record_read/write</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The C Interface</h2>

<p>The following calls can be made from the parallelized program to change the value of the two variables.  For example:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
#include <bop.h>
...
BOP_set_group_size(8);
BOP_set_verbose(0);
</pre>
